The ListLike package provides typeclasses and instances to allow
polymorphism over many common datatypes.

The package can be built/installed with Cabal.  If you have cabal-install,
simply run "cabal install ListLike" to install the package.  Without
cabal-install, execute the following commands:

$ runghc Setup.hs configure
